# schemeproj
I developed an interpreter for a subset of the Scheme language.
In Parts I and II, I developed the interpreter in several stages:
- Reading Scheme expressions
- Symbol evaluation
- Calling built-in procedures
- Definitions
- Lambda expressions and procedure definition
- Calling user-defined procedures
- Evaluation of special forms
In Part III, I implemented Scheme procedures.
